Correlation Matrix:
Highly Correlated Pairs of Variables
Operating Margin and EBITDA Margin
Correlation: 1.00
Total Assets (at) and Total Liabilities (lt)
Correlation: 1.00
Current Ratio and Quick Ratio
Correlation: 0.99
Debt-to-Assets and Working Capital to Assets
Correlation: -0.98
Goodwill (gdwl) and Intangible Assets (intan)
Correlation: 0.92
Total Revenue (revt) and Cost of Goods Sold (cogs)
Correlation: 0.92
Capital Expenditures (capx) and Depreciation (dp)
Correlation: 0.84
Accounts Payable (ap) and Cash Equivalents (che)
Correlation: 0.82
Goodwill to Assets and Intangible to Total Assets
Correlation: 0.80
The analysis reveals several key points:
Operating Margin and EBITDA Margin
Correlation: 1.00
Indicating they provide similar information. I retained only one using PCA to avoid redundancy.
Total Assets and Total Liabilities
Correlation: 1.00
Reflecting the fundamental accounting equation. I choose one using PCA to avoid multicollinearity.
Current Ratio and Quick Ratio
Correlation: 0.99
Both measure liquidity, but the Quick Ratio is more stringent. I included only one to streamline the
model.
Debt-to-Assets and Working Capital to Assets
Correlation: -0.98
This inverse relationship suggests that as debt increases, working capital relative to assets
decreases. Including both might be redundant.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Correlation: 0.92
Indicating they often vary together. I considered including only one to reduce redundancy.
Total Revenue and Cost of Goods Sold
Correlation: 0.92
This relationship is typical and is noted as COGS typically scales with revenue.
Capital Expenditures and Depreciation
Correlation: 0.84
Reflecting that higher capital expenditures lead to increased depreciation.
Accounts Payable and Cash Equivalents
Correlation: 0.82
Suggesting that changes in cash are closely linked to accounts payable.
Goodwill to Assets and Intangible to Total Assets
Correlation: 0.80
Indicating they move together in relation to asset values.
Across most variables, such as total assets (at), liabilities (lt), and common equity (ceq), there
remains a strong concentration near smaller values, with a sharp decline as the values increase. This
pattern suggests that most firms operate at a moderate scale, while only a few reach the higher
financial thresholds. Notably, the distribution for net income (ni) shows a more pronounced difference
between recession and non-recession periods, with recession periods exhibiting a tighter, more
negative distribution, indicative of the financial strain firms experience during economic downturns.
The cross-sectional analysis shows that even though many variables, such as cash flow from
operations (oancf) and capital expenditures (capx), exhibit right-skewed distributions, the difference
between recession and non-recession periods remains subtle for most variables, except for those
directly impacted by economic contractions. Variables like net income and dividends paid (dvp)
demonstrate clearer shifts during recession periods, where firms face more significant challenges.
Overall, the changes across periods reflect the resilience of most firms, with only a few key metrics
